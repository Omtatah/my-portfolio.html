      <p><strong>Murtallah Maninga Omtatah</strong>(born November 28 1999) is a male Kenyan citizen who aspires to be a <em>freelance coder.</em></p>
    <h2>Talents and Hobbies</h2>
    <p>A <strong>curious</strong>person <em>by nature</em>, I tend to spend my free time researching and discovering new phenomena that occur in the world or sometimes entirely new,albeit fictious, worlds.</p><p>As such, my hobbies tend to revolve around the idea of exploration and discovery. These include:
    <ol>
      <li>Reading books and novels</li>
      <li>Watching documentaries</li>
      <li>Playing fantasy and adventure games</li>
      <li>Writing poems and essays</li>
      <li>Attending <strong>networking</strong> events to meet new people who challenge my perspective</li><img src="pictures/me-at-atheists-meeting.pgn" alt="Me attending the monthly atheists-meeting"style="width:250px;height:250px">
    </ol>

    </ul>
    <h2>Personal life and Personality</h2>
    <p>A strong believer of personal confort and relaxation, people tend to mistake me for a lazy person however, it is worthwhili to note that this simply is not true. In retrospect, although I like to take it easy, I am easily the most driven person around when it comes to pursuing my passions(like reading books and taking photos).</p>
    <p>In am an open-minded individual who strongly supports secularism as a way of life. I tend to be very vocal about my ideologies especially when one tries to criticize me for them. I should however point out that although I am quick to defend my stand, I see no shame in admitting where I am wrong. If anything, one might argue that I indeed enjoy a challenging debate which ends with my ideologies being debunked. This is simply because loosing an arguement is an oppourtunity to grow and view the world through a different pair of eyes.</p>
    <p>
    <h2>Academic Qualifications</h2>
    <p>Here is the rather brief list of my education qualifications that I've managed to pull off in the barely two decades of my existance.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>2019 Enrolled at Mutungoni Academy where hopefully I will manage to gain enough knowledge to becme a freelance coder</li>
        <li>2018 Compeleted my KCSE with an Aggregate mean score of B+</li>
        <li>2014 Compeleted my KCPE and managed to attain a score of 390 marks</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Over the course of about a week now, I've been introduced to coding and programming. By employing the various skills I've obtained tus far, such as HTML and CSS, I have managed to carry out the following projects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Omtatah/hello-5-languages.git">hello-world-in-five-languages</a></li><p>This was a project that was made possible because of the guidance of Newton(the TM) who took his time to take me through the various instructions HTML uses to carry out its processes. The final result was a webpage where I managed to convey the message "Hello, world" in five different languages save English,these languages are: Swahili, Kibaganda, Kikalenjin, Kiluhya and Kikuyu.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Omtatah/HI.git">HI</a></li><p>HI is a self initiated project i carried out to test various HTML instructions and Git functions...although unimpressive to the experienced eye, it played a very significant role in allowing me to comprehend the various functions HTML incorporates in its operations</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Omtatah/self1.git">self1</a></li><p>Though the page is void of text, its purpose was to allow me to get to understand how to marry images into my projects thus it was a booming success.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Omtatah/webpage1.git">webpage1</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Omtatah/cookie-recipe-1.git">cookie-recepie-1</a></li><p>Although the initial document was forked from iantheninja's github page, it did contain tonnes of spacing and indenting errors that I fixed thus the final product has my work incorporated in it too.</p>
