      <p><strong>Murtallah Maninga Omtatah</strong>(born November 28 1999) is a male Kenyan citizen who aspires to be a <em>freelance coder.</em></p>
    <h2>Talents and Hobbies</h2>
    <p>A <strong>curious</strong>person <em>by nature</em>, I tend to spend my free time researching and discovering new phenomena that occur in the world or sometimes entirely new,albeit fictious, worlds.</p><p>As such, my hobbies tend to revolve around the idea of exploration and discovery. These include:
    <ol>
      Reading books and novels
      Watching documentaries
      Playing fantasy and adventure games
      
    </ol>

      <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Personal life and Personality</h2>
    <p>A strong believer of personal confort and relaxation, people tend to mistake me for a lazy person however, it is worthwhili to note that this simply is not true. In retrospect, although I like to take it easy, I am easily the most driven person around when it comes to pursuing my passions(like reading books and taking photos).</p>
    <p>In am an open-minded individual who strongly supports secularism as a way of life. I tend to be very vocal about my ideologies especially when one tries to criticize me for them. I should however point out that although I am quick to defend my stand, I see no shame in admitting where I am wrong. If anything, one might argue that I indeed enjoy a challenging debate which ends with my ideologies being debunked. This is simply because loosing an arguement is an oppourtunity to grow and view the world through a different pair of eyes.</p>
    <p>
    <h2>Academic Qualifications</h2>
    <p>Here is the rather brief list of my education qualifications that I've managed to pull off in the barely two decades of my existance.</p>
